# The Haskell code that kept the Goa Government's Door-to-door Covid Survey together

This repository holds the code that was used in the [Door-to-door Health Survey conducted by Department of Health, Government of Goa](https://www.saurabhnanda.in/2020/04/18/technology-used-in-goa-government-covid-survey/) between 13 - 15 April, 2020.

This code was written in a heavily sleep deprived state and with the only purpose of getting the job done... _fast!_ Absolutely no thought was given to redability or maintainability. **Please do not pick any coding practices from this repository - you have been warned!**
